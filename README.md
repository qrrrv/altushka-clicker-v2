# Altushka Clicker v2 (Vanilla JS Edition)

Altushka Clicker is a lightweight, entertaining web-based incremental game. This version has been completely refactored from its original React-based architecture into a streamlined implementation using pure **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. This transition ensures maximum compatibility and performance across all modern web browsers without the need for complex build tools or dependencies.

The core gameplay revolves around the accumulation of **Vibes**, the primary in-game currency. Players can increase their earnings through two main mechanisms: manual clicking and passive investments. As players progress, they unlock new visual content and reach higher loyalty levels, reflecting their status within the game's ecosystem.

### Game Mechanics and Features

The game features a robust progression system designed to keep players engaged through various upgrades and strategic investments. The following table outlines the primary components of the game:

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Vibes** | The central currency earned through clicking and passive income. |
| **Upgrades** | Equipment such as RGB mats and mechanical keyboards that boost vibes per click. |
| **Investments** | Social media platforms like Telegram and Twitch that provide automated income. |
| **Loyalty Levels** | A progression metric that unlocks new character photographs as it increases. |
| **Theme Support** | A toggleable interface allowing users to switch between light and dark modes. |
| **Persistence** | Automatic state management using browser LocalStorage to preserve progress. |

### Technical Implementation

The project utilizes modern web standards to deliver a responsive and interactive experience. **CSS Custom Properties** are employed for seamless theme switching, while **Flexbox** and **Grid** layouts ensure the interface adapts to various screen sizes. The game logic is handled by a modular JavaScript architecture that manages state, audio feedback via the **Web Audio API**, and dynamic UI updates.

To launch the game, simply open the `index.html` file in any standard web browser. No installation or server configuration is required, making it an ideal example of a portable, client-side web application.
